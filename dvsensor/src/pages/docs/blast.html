<h2> Setting up a local BLAST database </h2>

<p>
    In order to use the BLAST feature of DVSensor, a working system installation of BLAST is required. The latest BLAST
    installers can be downloaded from the
    <a href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/" >NCBI website</a> or using the package
    manager on Linux systems. To check if the installation was successful, run "blastn -version" in a terminal
    (cmd.exe on Windows) and see if it returns the BLAST version number.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the BLAST executables, a BLAST database is required. These can be downloaded
    from the <a href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/doc/blast-help/downloadblastdata.html" >NCBI website</a> as well.
    A useful mRNA database is the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/refseq_select/">RefSeq Select RNA</a>
    database. Download the <a href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/" >archive</a>
    (refseq_select_rna.tar.gz) from the NCBI website and extract it. The extracted directory contains different files
    which should not be renamed, deleted or changed. You should also not add any new files to this directory.
    The database path refers to the path of this directory, and the database name refers to the stem of the filenames
    inside the directory (e.g. "refseq_select_rna" for the RefSeq Select RNA database). Both the database path and the
    database name have to be entered in order to run BLAST queries.
