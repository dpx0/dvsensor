<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>
    DVSensor is a software tool which allows you to create DART VADAR sensors for any mRNA targets.
    DART VADAR sensors, first described by Gayet et al.
    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36851-z">[1]</a>, are mRNA constructs which facilitate
    conditional mRNA translation based on the detection of target mRNA molecules. The DART VADAR mRNA can only be
    translated after it hybridizes with its target mRNA, which activates the sensor and allows the translation of an
    encoded payload gene. DVSensor takes a target mRNA sequence as input, either in FASTA or GenBank format, and
    generates possible DART VADAR sensor sequences as output.
</p>
<p>
    The sensor sequences can then be cloned into a suitable DART VADAR
    expression vector, such as pASTERISK. The software offers a variety of settings for controlling how the sensors
    are generated. In addition, it comes with a built-in feature for evaluating the specificity of the generated sensor
    sequences. By querying mRNA databases using BLAST, it can identify potential off-target mRNA transcripts other than
    the intended target that may also be able to activate the sensor.
