<h2> Editing the sequence record information </h2>

<p>
    The sequence name and NCBI accession number are extracted from the uploaded sequence record. Usually, the sequence
    name gets interpreted as the accession number, which may not be desired. Therefore, you can change both the
    sequence name and accession number (see below).

    Changing the name has no effect on the computation or the results, but the accession number has to be correct
    in order for BLAST queries to work properly. Click "OK" when you are done.
