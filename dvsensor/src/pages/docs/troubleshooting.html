<h2> Troubleshooting </h2>

<p>
    <i>The webpage only displays a white screen.</i> <br>
    <b>Solution:</b> Restart the application and wait a few seconds, it may take a while for the page to
    load the first time.
</p> <br>
<p>
    <i>The content of the page doesn't properly fit the screen.</i> <br>
    <b>Solution:</b> The pages may look different depending on the screen size of your device. Use the zoom-in/out
    feature of your browser to adjust the content size.
</p> <br>
<p>
    <i>I receive the notification "Windows firewall has blocked some features of this app". </i> <br>
    <b>Solution:</b> Click the "Allow" button. The application does not send any data over the internet, but needs
    to open a locally running web server on your computer (which only you have access to). This is why the firewall
    might block the application.
</p> <br>
<p>
    <i>I see a notification "Connection Lost. Trying to reconnect...".</i> <br>
    <b>Solution:</b> You most likely have accidentally reloaded the page, used your browsers navigation buttons or
    have otherwise shut down the app. Restart the application as usual.
</p> <br>
<p>
    <i>I see a page saying: "error: page not available".</i> <br>
    <b>Solution:</b> Click the "go to main menu" button.
</p> <br>
<p>
    <i>When I upload a file, I see this error: "This file could not be read. Please upload a file in FASTA or
        Genbank format."
    </i> <br>
    <b>Solution:</b> Make sure that the file you are uploading is a valid FASTA or GenBank record. This error usually
    indicates an error with the file encoding.
</p> <br>
<p>
    <i>When I upload a file, I see this error: "This file is too large. Maximum file size: 500 KB".</i> <br>
    <b>Solution:</b> The file / sequence size for sequence record uploads is limited to 500KB, which is more than
    enough for mRNA records. Make sure that your file does not contain more than one sequence record.
</p> <br>
<p>
    <i>When I upload a file or enter a sequence, I see this error: "This is not a single-record FASTA/GenBank sequence.
        Please upload a file in FASTA/GenBank format or manually enter a sequence."</i> <br>
    <b>Solution:</b> Make sure that the file you are uploading / the sequence record you are entering is a valid
    FASTA or GenBank record. Also make sure that only one sequence record is contained within the file, as FASTA
    files can have multiple sequence records.
</p> <br>
<p>
    <i>On the options page, I see the error "no blast installation detected".</i> <br>
    <b>Solution:</b> Make sure you have a working system installation of BLAST, in particular the blastn program
    which comes bundled with the NCBI BLAST+ executables. Run "blastn -version" in a terminal / command line and see
    if it returns the blastn version number. Note that you can use DVSensor without the BLAST feature, but you won't
    receive a report on potential off-targets.
</p> <br>
<p>
    <i>When I click "run analysis", I get the error "invalid blast database".</i> <br>
    <b>Solution:</b> This could have several reasons, all indicating a problem with the specified BLAST database.
    One reason could be that you entered the wrong database name. Make sure the name matches the filename stem of
    the files inside the database directory. You should never rename, delete or add new files in the database
    directory. If you still get an error, your blast database may be corrupted or there may be another issue. Use the
    blastdbcheck tool to test the database integrity by running this command inside the database directory:
    "blastdbcheck -db &ltdatabase name&gt".
</p> <br>
<p>
    <i>When I click "run analysis", I get the error "could not validate blast database: blastdbcheck missing".</i> <br>
    <b>Solution:</b> Make sure you have a working system installation of BLAST, in particular the blastdbcheck program
    which comes bundled with the NCBI BLAST+ executables. Run "blastdbcheck -version" in a terminal / command line
    and see if it returns the blastdbcheck version number.
</p> <br>
<p>
    <i>When I click "run analysis", I get the error "directory ... not found".</i> <br>
    <b>Solution:</b> Make sure you have entered a correct path to the directory containing the BLAST database files.
</p> <br>
<p>
    <i>The potential off-targets are reported as "N.A.", even though I selected the "run BLAST" option.</i> <br>
    <b>Solution:</b> Make sure you entered a correct taxonomic ID and that the database contains sequences associated
    with that taxonomic ID. If this wasn't the error, check if your blast setup works correctly by running a test
    query against your database: "blastn -db &ltdatabase_name&gt -query &ltquery.fasta&gt â€‘taxids &lttaxonomic ID&gt"
    (for the RefSeq Select RNA database, &ltdatabase_name&gt=refseq_select_rna). This command should be run in a
    terminal / command line inside the database directory. Choose a FASTA file for &ltquery.fasta&gt with a record
    that you are sure is contained in the database.
</p> <br>
<p>
    <i>Nothing happens when I click "export table as CSV".</i> <br>
    <b>Solution:</b> On Chromium-based browsers (such as Google Chrome or Brave), you may need to allow automatic
    downloads for that page. Click the icon in the URL bar that indicates a blocked download and select "Always allow".
